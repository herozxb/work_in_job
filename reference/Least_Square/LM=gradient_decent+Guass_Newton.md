    The Levenberg-Marquardt curve-fitting method is actually a combination of two minimization methods: the gradient descent method and the Gauss-Newton method. In the gradient descent method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by updating the parameters in the steepest-descent direction. In the Gauss-Newton method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by assuming the least squares function is locally quadratic and finding the minimum of the quadratic. The Levenberg-Marquardt method acts more like a gradient-descent method when the parameters are far from their optimal value, and acts more like the Gauss-Newton method when the parameters are close to their optimal value. This document describes these methods and illustrates the use of software to solve nonlinear least squares curve-fitting problems.
